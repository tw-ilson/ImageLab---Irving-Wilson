Tom Wilson and Ben Irving - IME processing

The general purpose of this assignment is to successfully process images of all different formats,
and perform various transformations to those files. In this assignment, we handled the blurring
and sharpening of images, and support for monochrome and sepia images. The image format that we
primarily worked with was the PPM format, though we ensured that we had support for other formats,
should the need arise.

Then, our ImageProcessorModel extends this ImageProcessorIO. The purpose of this interface is to
represent the model which can perform the desired imager alterations. The abstractImageProcessor'
model implements this interface. The general purpose of this class is to handle the import and
export functionality itself, and to leave the possibility for different implementations
of the model itself open.

Our simpleImageProcessorModel is a simple instance of this class, extending AbstractImageProcessor
Model, supporting the basic functionality for taking and working with a single image.
It also stores all versions of the provided image. This class serves to perform the basic
operations described above.

The fileType enum serves to represent the possible filetypes, which for this class was simply the
PPM filetype.

The images themselves are represented by our Image interface, which represents an Image with a
width, height, and an array of pixels, where each value in array represents the color of that pixel.

The abstractImage class implements the Image interface, which provides the functionality for
the simple image operations. The abstract class allows for further extension on the image
functionality.
The SimpleImage class extends the abstractImage class, holding a copy constructor which serves
to create a copy of the image provided. The simpleImage class does not hold any additional
functionality beyond this, but serves as a benchmark for possible future implementations.

For the Colors represented within the pixels, we created a Color interface, which represents a
color with a red, blue and green channel. We made this an interface so that we could create
multiple possible implementations of the Color data type in the future.
We then created a light color class, which utilizes a 32 bit number to represent its RGB values.

For the filters themselves, we created a Filter interface, which represents the filter that
can be applied to the image. Separately from this interface, we created a FilterBuilder
class, which allows us to construct the filters and add them to a general purpose hashmap which
stores all of the types of filters. This would be the class that we would add future filters to,
so as not to disturb any other functionality. It contains support for two types of filters, a
color filter, and a kernel filter, supporting the required types for this assignment.

The kernel filter class implements our filter interface, and supports the construction of a new
image with the given kernel filter applied to it. The ColorFilter implements our filter interface
as well, and supports the construction of a new image with the given color filter applied to it.

"bay.ppm" and "glacier.ppm" are the property of Benjamin Irving and Thomas Wilson.
We approve of their use for this project.

/// Homework 6 additions

The primary changes to this project were in the SimpleLayeredImage class, which stemmed from the
layeredImage interface. The layeredImage interface extended the image interface, but added
new functionality which allowed our image to behave like a stack of individual images. These
images could ideally be manipulated and changed at the clients whim. The SimpleLayeredImage
itself is the layered image object, and all the associated functionality (adding/removing
a layer, loading an image into the layer, editing a layer, retrieving the topMostVisible layer).

On top of the previous functionality, we have added the ImageProcessorController interface, which
represents the controller functionality for this project. It handles the batch commands, or the
image-processing commands that the user wishes to handle. The ImageUtils class is an instance
of the ImageProcessorController, and allows the client to load, save, and manipulate images.

The SimpleImageController itself handles this functionality, reading the commands from the user
and handling them with the new LayeredImageModel, which is a model that is quite similar to the
SimpleImageModel, but instead can handle the functionality associated with a layered image, which
includes the editing of individual layers, the adding/removing of layers, the changing of the
invisibility, etc.)

We also moved all of our image handling to the controller level of the program, as the model
handles the internal data and not the external data being fed into the controller. The model
is the backend of our program, and as such should not be associated with the external data.


// Homework 7 additions

The primary changes from homework 6 to homework 7 was the addition of the Graphical interface
view, through which the user can interact with the program.

A new class was created, the JFrameView class, which holds all of the code that allows the user
to interact with the program through the GUI. It builds the GUI, and communicates with the
controller to display the correct data.

We did make some changes to the ImageProcessorView interface to support this new view, particularly
the displayImage method with allows the JFrameView to interpret image data, and the
displayLayers method which allows the JFrameView to interpret the layers from the controller.
This additional functionality ensures that Batch Commands update the view accordingly.

To the controller, we made some drastic changes. We added a new interface, the Features interface,
which represents the functionality that the controller has to handle through the
GUI, in order to update the model along with what the client actually sees on the screen
correctly.

Implementing the interface was the StandardFeatures class, which actually implements
the functionality dictated above. It holds the data from the model and the view, able to receive
commands that the view "hears", and act upon them by updating the model on the backend.

ImageGUIController is merely code which creates an instance of the GUI view, which is fed an
instance of the features class containing the corresponding model and the view itself. This web of
functionality allows for live-time updates of the view according with the data
changes handled in the model.

In terms of additional functionality, we also added the ability to resize an image. We added
an additional method to the abstract image class, which handled the brunt of the actual resize
image operation. Then we added a resize method to the image interface, which used this abstract
method in all of the subsequent image classes. This functionality was then included in the GUI,
along with the features class to handle this new alteration.

We also added the ability to create a Mosaic image. The process of introducing this additional
functionality was actually quite similar to that of resize. A method to handle the brunt of the
calculations was added to the AbstractImage class (to be used by all subsequent image classes), and
then a method which uses these calculations was added to the image interface, which allowed the
implementation to vary from a simple image to a layered image, for instance.
