****************************************** HOW TO USE **********************************************
When run with 'java ImageProcessor -interactive' :

 * Primary navigation of the program can be done with the menu bar at top. Major categories are
 'File', 'Layer', and 'Filter'.

 * In the 'File' menu, 'Import...' will bring up a dialog to choose what image to load in the
 current layer. The current layer defaults to the most recently added layer, otherwise it can be
 selected in the list of layers at right. 'Import all...' saves the selected image into all
 currently working layers.
   'Export...' will bring up the dialog to choose a path to save the current image on-screen.
 The format in which to save the image can be selected by adding the desired file extension to the
 end of the path. 'Export all...' saves all currently visible images with the provided name. For
 Example, if the name "save.png" was provided and there are four layers, the files save0.png,
 save1.png, save2.png, and save3.png would be saved.

 * 'Batch' will bring up a dialog to select a text file to load as a set of commands to complete, in
 the format of the commands used int the text interface. Note that resizing and mosaic are not
 supported as text commands

 * 'Quit' will attempt to quit the program, bringing up a prompt to save changes. if 'Yes' is
 selected, 'Export all...' is executed. This is the preferred way to quit the program.

 * In the 'Layer' menu, options are provided to add or remove a layer to the program, for which a
 name is requested.

 * In the 'Filter' menu, several options for filters can be applied to the current layer. The
 options are 'Blur', 'Sharpen', 'Sepia', and 'Greyscale', as well as the newly added 'Mosaic' option.
 Support for custom filters is on the way.

 * Additionally, the Visibility menu tab allows the user to set the visibility of the currently
 selected layer.

 * the "Resize" item on the top bar can be used to resize the image to a smaller size.

 * On the right, the list of layers can be seen. Order is not necessarily indicated by the order in
 which they appear. The current layer appears in blue if manually selected.

When run with 'java ImageProcessor -text' :

                                      -- List of commands --
Use:
    > create layer <name_of_layer>
to create a new layer with the given name. A new layer becomes the 'current' layer upon creation.

Use:
    > current <name_of_layer>
to set the specified layer as the current layer, if a layer with such a name exists.

Use:
    > filter <name_of_filter>
to apply the specified filter the the image stored at the current layer.

Use:
    > load <path_to_file>
to load the specified image into the layer that is selected as 'current'

Use:
    > save <file_to_create.ext>
to save the current file (or if the current file is invisible, the top-most visible layer) to the
file path specified as argument. The format of the file created can be specified by the extension
supplied with the argument, and if no extension is specified, format defaults to JPEG, and .jpeg
is appended to the name of the file.

Use:
    > invisible <name_of_layer>
to set the specified layer to be invisible, meaning that it cannot be saved.

Use:
    > visible <name_of_layer>
to set the specified layer to be visible, meaning that it can be saved.

Use:
    > list
