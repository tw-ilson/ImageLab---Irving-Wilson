Tom Wilson and Ben Irving - IME processing

The general purpose of this assignment is to successfully process images of all different formats,
and perform various transformations to those files. In this assignment, we handled the blurring
and sharpening of images, and support for monochrome and sepia images. The image format that we
primarily worked with was the PPM format, though we ensured that we had support for other formats.

The operations in our ImageProcessor are handled by the ImageProcessorIO interface, which contains
3 methods.

The images themselves are represented by our Image interface, which represents an Image with a
width, height, and an array of pixels, where each value in array represents the color of that pixel.
