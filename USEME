How to use:
  When the program is started with run(Readable input), where 'input' is the source of text commands,
a new LayeredImageModel is created which has no layers and no images stored. The controller proceeds
to process any provided source of input to parse commands to issue to the program. Note that command
arguments are separated by spaces, and individual commands are separated by line separators. For
instance, if a user attempts to give a command name on one line, and its arguments on the next, the
command will fail.
                                      -- List of commands --
Use:
    > create layer <name_of_layer>
to create a new layer with the given name. A new layer becomes the 'current' layer upon creation.

Use:
    > current <name_of_layer>
to set the specified layer as the current layer, if a layer with such a name exists.

Use:
    > filter <name_of_filter>
to apply the specified filter the the image stored at the current layer.

Use:
    > load <path_to_file>
to load the specified image into the layer that is selected as 'current'

Use:
    > save <file_to_create.ext>
to save the current file (or if the current file is invisible, the top-most visible layer) to the
file path specified as argument. The format of the file created can be specified by the extension
supplied with the argument, and if no extension is specified, format defaults to JPEG, and .jpeg
is appended to the name of the file.

Use:
    > invisible <name_of_layer>
to set the specified layer to be invisible, meaning that it cannot be saved.

Use:
    > visible <name_of_layer>
to set the specified layer to be visible, meaning that it can be saved.

Use:
    > list
to list the names of all layers.

Use:
    > q
or
    > quit
to end the program run.
